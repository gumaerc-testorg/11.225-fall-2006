## Weekly Readings

In order to be able to write arguments, you need to read well-written published arguments. So, each week you should be reading 5 to 10 opinion/editorial pieces. Op-Ed pieces are a good way to learn about how to write concisely and how to create a persuasive argument. Op-Ed pieces can be found in any newspaper, but here are a few Web links to make it really easy.
